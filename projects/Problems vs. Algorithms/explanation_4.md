# Problem 4: Dutch National Flag Problem

For this problem we do a single while loop adding O(n) time complexity. By switching the 0s and 2s because the 1s will automatically fall into their correct places.

## Time and Space complexity

**Time → O(n)**, because we have a single while loop

**Space → O(1)**, because we return the same array with it’s elements sorted
