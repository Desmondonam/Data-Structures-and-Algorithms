Task 0:
Worst case time-complexity is Big O(1)
The time-complexity for this program is Big O(1) because we are not iterating the elements from input lists (calls or texts).
We are accessing the first and last value from the lists (calls and texts) by an index.

Task 1:
Worst case time-complexity is Big O(2n)
The time-complexity for this program is Big O(2n) because we are iterating the elements from lists calls and texts.

Task 2:
Worst case time-complexity is Big O(2n)
The time-complexity for this program is Big O(2n) because we are iterating the elements from lists calls and texts.

Task 3:
Worst case time-complexity is Big O(n)
The time-complexity for this program is Big O(n) because we are iterating the elements from the list calls.

Task 4:
Worst case time-complexity is Big O(3n)
The time-complexity for this program is Big O(3n) because we are iterating the elements from the list calls.
After that we are iterating the elements from the list texts.
And finally we are iterating the elements of the list outgoingCallsList.
